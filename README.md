This is my Corona Blitz entry for the following contest:

http://forums.coronalabs.com/topic/44110-coronablitz-2-theme-and-information/


All of the core code and ui were all done within the 4 hour contest window.

I did however, add the buy screen, and added the sounds for an hour and a half outside of the 4 hour window. Without creating and connecting the buy screen to the core engine the game would have not really been playable as you could not inrease levels.

Thanks for your time.

Here is the youtube video of the application:
